## Why this project?

The goal of this project is to present a standard architecture of python repository/package
including a full CiCd pipeline to document/test/deploy your project with standard methods
of 2022. It can be used as starting point for any project without reinventing the wheel.

## The code has no interest!

The code of this project is totally dummy: it makes simple
mathematics operations like addition and subtration!
The next iteration will make the opetations more interesting by
using multi-layers perceptron! It will try to add a complete example of Hydra
configuration.
<br/><br/>In a close future, it will serve as a demonstrator by the example
of a standard ML pipeline for experimentation and production
